      In the process of internal desktop applications development, many different design specs and
      implementations would be involved, which might cause designers and developers difficulties and
      duplication and reduce the efficiency of development. After massive project practice and
      summaries, Ant Design, a design language for background applications, is refined by Ant UED
      Team, which aims to uniform the user interface specs for internal background projects, lower
      the unnecessary cost of design differences and implementation and liberate the resources of
      design and front-end development.
